# Webpage Example

## Overview

This is a basic registration webpage made with HTML, CSS, and JS. It opens to a homepage with a basic navbar, responsive buttons, and responsive webpage size. The pages labeled "Tech" and "Products" do not go to other pages but are set up to be built upon if desired. 

### How to Run

1. To run this you need to have Node.js installed in your system [https://nodejs.org/en/download/]. 

2. Run the command `npm install http-server -g`

3. After that navigate to the specific path of your file folder in command prompt and run the commmand `http-server` **note: may need to run as administrator**.
 
4. Then go to your browser and type localhost:8080. The application should run.
