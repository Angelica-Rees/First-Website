# Webpage Example

## Overview

This is a basic registration webpage made with HTML, CSS, and JS. It opens to a homepage with a basic navbar, responsive buttons, and responsive webpage size. The pages labeled "Tech" and "Products" do not go to other pages but are set up to be built upon if desired. 

### How to Run

To run this, you need to download Visual Studio code(VS code). The following is a link to the download for VS code:

Then you can download the files in this repository and open them on VS code. Additionally, you will need to downlioad the extension for "live server". Then open the index.html and press ctrl+p. Type ">live server: open with live server" and this will open a browser with the webpage.
